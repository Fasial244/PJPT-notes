# Practice & Assessments

The “assments” page in your notes provides an overview of the topics assessed in the course.  Use this checklist to review each domain before your test day:

## Network pentest

Focus on reconnaissance, scanning and exploitation of network services.  Practise Nmap scanning, service enumeration, password attacks and pivoting through internal networks.

## OSINT

Gather publicly available information about an organization: domain registrations, employee emails, job postings and social media.  Tools include search engine dorking, Maltego and data breach sites.

## Internal pentest (AD methodology)

Review Active Directory attacks such as LLMNR poisoning, SMB relay, Kerberoasting and privilege escalation.  Practise using Responder, ntlmrelayx, BloodHound and Impacket tools.

## Web application pentest

Familiarise yourself with OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (injection, broken authentication, sensitive data exposure, etc.).  Practise using Burp Suite, DirBuster, Nikto and custom scripts to find and exploit web flaws.

## Wireless pentest

Understand Wi‑Fi encryption schemes and practise capturing and cracking handshakes.  Test segmentation and perform controlled deauthentication attacks.

Use these topics as a revision guide.  For hands‑on practice, set up a lab environment and work through exercises in each domain.
