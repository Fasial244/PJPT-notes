# Wireless Pentest

Wireless networks present unique attack surfaces.  Although your notes only briefly mention this domain, here is a concise overview to guide your studies.

## Basics of Wi‑Fi security

- **Segmentation:** separate guest and corporate wireless networks.  Avoid bridging wireless directly into internal VLANs.
- **Authentication:** WPA2‑PSK is common in home networks; enterprise networks use WPA2‑Enterprise with 802.1X and RADIUS.  WEP and WPA are insecure and should be avoided.
- **Encryption keys:** pre‑shared keys (PSK) should be long and random.  Use enterprise authentication (EAP‑TLS, PEAP) for stronger security.

## Attack techniques

- **Handshake capture:** capture the 4‑way handshake using `aircrack-ng` or `hcxdumptool` and perform offline dictionary attacks.  Tools like Hashcat can crack weak passphrases.
- **PMKID attack:** some routers leak the Pairwise Master Key ID in association frames; capturing this allows offline cracking without client interaction.
- **Deauthentication attacks:** send forged deauth frames to force clients to reconnect, enabling handshake capture.  Use responsibly in authorised labs.
- **Rogue access points / Evil Twin:** set up a malicious AP with the same SSID to trick clients into connecting; then perform man‑in‑the‑middle attacks.
- **Packet injection:** inject crafted frames to test network segmentation and resilience.  Ensure your wireless adapter supports monitor mode and injection.

## Defence

Deploy strong passwords, enable WPA3/WPA2‑Enterprise, disable WPS, update firmware regularly and monitor for rogue APs.  Consider segmenting IoT devices into separate VLANs.

Wireless pentesting requires specialised hardware and adherence to regulations; always obtain permission before performing any of the above techniques.
